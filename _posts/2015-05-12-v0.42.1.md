This is version 0.42.1 of Kallisto. We recommend that users upgrade to this version.

Updates include

- `index`
    + now accepts multiple FASTA files and creates an index of all the targets
    + transcripts that end with polyA, runs of length 10 or greater have the polyA tail clipped

- `quant`
    + now accepts multiple FASTQ paired end files, or single-end files
    + `--single` flag to specify single-end reads
    + simplified jumping rules
    + uses soft-intersect, if one read has no mapping k-mers the other end is used for pseudoalignment
